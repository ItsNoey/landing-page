# landing-page (Sawaddee)

This project is tasked by The Odin Project. I couldn't help making it more personal, and I went with something close (literally) to home, Thailand.
Even though, I provided some information about Thailand, I'm more excited to play around and style this page. I'm not sure if I will add anything. I will update the README file again when I finish.
