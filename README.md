## Landing Page (Sawaddee)

This project is tasked by The Odin Project. I couldn't help making it more personal, and I went with something close (literally) to home, Thailand. 

I wanted to showcase some of Thailand's most beautiful temples. Some personal suggestions are given, but they are hardly helpful. I also provided links to information about each temple and a Thai travel blog from a highly-regarded source.

Nevertheless, what I enjoyed most about the project was implementing Responsive Design. Please see the screenshots of the project below.
