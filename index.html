        <h1>Thinking of Visiting Thailand?</h1>
        <p>
          This site might not give you much as it is only to satisfy an
          assignment by The Odin Project. I did provide some info, but it is
          merely enough. Nevertheless, Thailand is waiting for your visit!
        </p>
        <p>
          I do recommend you to check out Richard Barrow's
          <a href="https://www.richardbarrow.com/" target="_blank"> blog</a>. I
          find him truly insightful and helpful, coming from a Thai person.

      <h3>When to Visit</h3>
      <p>
        I highly recommend that you visit Thailand anytime from November to
        February. By November, it is usually not rainy season anymore. But, in
        2022, we still had to deal with some rain. Climate change, am i right?
      </p>

      <h3>Where to Visit</h3>
      <p>
        Indeed, I am Thai, but I am still a stranger to many parts of my
        country. I can say that you should give a few days to Bangkok. Stay in
        the Thonburi or Sathorn area, if you want to visit the temples and art
        scenes. Stay in Sukhumvit, if you want to be near all the convenience
        and city vibe. It can be overwhelming, just fyi. Other than that, I am
        quite useless. Please Google, because I do, too.
      </p>

      <p>I will give a few typical suggestions for provinces to visit.</p>

      <ul>
        <span>Some provinces to visit</span>
        <li>Chiang Mai</li>
        <li>Surattani</li>
        <li>Krabi</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you do come here, I hope you get to enjoy our cultures and the
        kindness of our people. There is so much to see. Be mindful of where you
        choose to go.
